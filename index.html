      Every day with you feels like a beautiful gift, and when I am with you I never want to leave.
       This past year has been an incredible journey, and Iâ€™m so grateful that God brought you 
       into my life. Your laughter, kindness, and love light up my world, and I cherish every moment
        we share. I look forward to chasing our dreams and creating countless memories together.
         Thank you for being my Valentine today and always.
